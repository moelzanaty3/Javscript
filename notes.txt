-> Take responsibility for your learning
-> Difficulty ramps up considerably, but if you stick
   with it you will reap the rewards
-> Functional Programming
    ->> it's about breaking up your code into verbs.
    ->> OOP is about breaking up your code into nouns.
    ->> a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs
    ->> treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions
    ->> avoids changing-state and mutable data.

-> any thing that ever uses a DOT in javascript is an object
-> storing value by reference or by value
-> primitive type get passed by value
-> non-primitive type get passed by reference
-> mutating means updating and changing
-> immutable means can NOT update or change it.
-> arrays that are just object


- JS: The Hard Parts 
    - Global Execution Context 
        - Thread of execution (parsing and executing the code line after line).
        - Live memory of variables with data (known as Global Variabled Environment).
